# Bayesian AB Tests with Pymc3

This project shows an example of bayesian AB Tests with Pymc3.

AB Test bayesian.ipynb is a Jupyter notebook with an example.

You can find this same example for the Databricks platform in the folder notebooks_for_databricks. There're a .py and .html files.

The resources that helped me to build it are the following:
- Very nice and brief introduction to bayesian AB tests: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRLI_KbvZTQ&t=293s
- An example: https://medium.com/ni-tech-talk/optimizing-revenue-with-bayesian-a-b-testing-5068e8ac41ea
- Another example that helps to interpret the results: https://towardsdatascience.com/a-b-testing-with-probabilistic-programming-and-pymc3-part-i-7ae52d45bc41

You can find the documentation of Pymc3 here:
